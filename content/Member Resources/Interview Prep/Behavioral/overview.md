# Don't Just Grind Leetcode — How to Stand Out in Interviews

A common mistake I see is people focusing *only* on solving Leetcode problems when preparing for interviews. While technical skills matter, I believe the behavioral side of interviews is just as — if not more — important.

## Why Does This Matter?

Interviewers are human. If they like you, they'll want to advocate for you. Being personable, thoughtful, and curious can often be the difference-maker between "good candidate" and "must-hire."

---

## What Does This Look Like in Practice?

### 1. Have a Strong Elevator Pitch

At the start of an interview, you'll almost always be asked to introduce yourself. Don't waste this moment by saying something like *"My favorite language is Python."*

Instead, share something personal or unique about yourself — something memorable. This could be:

- A quick story
- A passion project
- An unusual hobby
- A past experience that shaped you

Make them remember *you*, not just your tech stack.

### 2. Treat the Interview Like a Conversation

Interviews aren't interrogations — they're two-way conversations.

Ask your interviewer questions throughout the discussion. Show genuine curiosity. For example:

> In my Palantir interview, the hiring manager asked me why I wanted to work there. I shared my reasoning, but then followed up with:
>
> *"Do you think I’ll find that here? What excites you about working at Palantir?"*
>
> This turned the interview into a great conversation, and it became clear that what she loved about the company aligned with what I was looking for.

### 3. Always Ask Questions at the End

Never skip this.

Prepare questions ahead of time — ideally specific to the company or role. I keep a running list of questions in a notebook for each interview I do.

If you need inspiration, this GitHub repo has a great list of ideas (though I usually tweak them to sound more natural):

### 4. Soft Skills Matter — Even in Technical Rounds

Even if it's a purely technical round, I *always* try to bring in some conversational elements.

Example:
> In my Stripe interview, the interviewer stayed on the call for 30 minutes *after* the interview ended. We talked about Stripe, the industry, my goals — and he shared advice I still think about today. That never would’ve happened if I treated it like a code-only session.

## 5. Understand and Align with Company Values

Most companies publish their values, operating principles, or mission statements online. Read them.

If they genuinely resonate with you, say so. Share stories or examples that connect to those values. This shows that you’re not just applying anywhere — you want *this* role at *this* company.

## Final Thoughts

Technical prep gets you in the door.

But what makes you stand out — what makes people want to work with you — is who you are beyond the code.

Be curious. Be conversational. Be human.
