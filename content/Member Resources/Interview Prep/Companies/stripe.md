## 1. First Round — Coding Interview

This is a technical interview with an engineer.

### Format:
- ~45 minutes
- One coding question that builds over 4 parts
- Each part expands on the previous solution
- Style is similar to Stripe’s Online Assessment (OA)

### Best Practices:
- Ask clarifying questions at the start
- Explain your approach out loud
- Write clean, correct code
- Talk while coding
- Discuss testing, debugging, and edge cases

## 2. Onsite Interview

### Intern — 2 Rounds  
### New Grad — 3 Rounds  

#### 1. Programming Exercise
- Very similar to the first-round coding interview
- Graded on:
  - Correctness
  - Testing/debugging skills
  - Communication and thought process
  - Clean code style

#### 2. Integration Exercise
- You download a provided repo
- Build a new feature inside an existing codebase
- Focus is on:
  - Navigating unfamiliar code
  - Understanding system design
  - Implementing new functionality cleanly
  - Communicating clearly

> *This is a very practical, real-world style interview — treat it like adding a feature at work.*

#### 3. Bug Bash (New Grad Only)
- Download a repo with existing code
- Your task is to:
  1. Find the bugs
  2. Diagnose the root cause
  3. Fix the bugs
  4. Test your fixes

### Focus Areas:
- Troubleshooting & debugging skills
- Methodical problem-solving
- Clear explanations of how you identified and fixed issues

> *Note: They don’t want guesswork or random code changes — they care about your investigative process.*

## 3. Final Round — Manager Chat

- Standard behavioral interview
- Expect resume deep dives
- STAR format answers are ideal
- Prepare stories around:
  - Impact
  - Ownership
  - Teamwork
  - Challenges & growth

---

## Final Tips

- Be ready to explain your thought process clearly at every stage
- Testing, debugging, and clean code are critical at Stripe — not just getting the "right" answer
- Integration & Bug Bash rounds are unique — practice reading unfamiliar codebases if you can
- Study Stripe's company values, mission, and recent news
- Come prepared with thoughtful questions for the manager chat
