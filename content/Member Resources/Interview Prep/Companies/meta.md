# Meta Interview Guide (Intern & New Grad)

---

## Interview Process Overview

### 1. Initial Recruiter Outreach

The process starts with a recruiter email asking if you’re interested in interviewing.

They may ask a few basic questions (e.g., timeline, resume clarifications). If you say yes, they will send:

- An Online Assessment (OA) — coding problems
- A Behavioral Questionnaire — written responses to behavioral-style questions

After that, you'll move to the interview stage.

## 2. Interview Structure

| Role        | Rounds                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Intern      | 1 Coding Interview                       |
| New Grad    | 2 Coding Interviews + 1 Behavioral Round |

## Coding Interview(s)

- Length: 45 minutes
- Format: 2 coding questions
  - Usually either:
    - 2 Mediums
    - or 1 Easy + 1 Hard
- Typical Leetcode-style interview expectations:
  - Ask clarifying questions at the start
  - Talk through your approach out loud
  - Write clean, optimal code
  - Handle edge cases
  - Discuss time & space complexity

> Note: From what I’ve seen, **you need to fully and optimally solve both questions** to receive an offer.

---

## Behavioral Interview (New grad only)

- Length: 45 minutes
- Format: Standard behavioral questions (STAR format)
  - e.g., *"Tell me about a time you had a conflict..."*
  - *"Tell me about a time you showed leadership..."*

> I used the same STAR spreadsheet I made for Amazon interviews, just expanded with more stories & metrics.

Expect some resume deep dive as well similar to databricks.

## 3. Critical Advice — USE META'S RESOURCES

One of the best things about the Meta interview process is the sheer amount of resources they provide — take advantage of ALL of them.

### Available Resources (Highly Recommended)
- Weekly Mock Interview Zoom sessions  
  - Meta engineers live-solve problems  
  - They explain exactly what interviewers look for

- Meta Career Hub Practice Problems  
  - Official Meta practice questions

- Interview Prep Videos  
  - By Gayle Laakmann McDowell (Author of *Cracking the Coding Interview*)

- Coffee Chats with Meta Engineers  
  - Opportunity to learn about team culture  
  - Come prepared with thoughtful questions — respect their time!

> Tip: Using these resources is a huge advantage — don’t skip them.

## 4. Offer Timeline

My offer came in a few days — but that was because I had other offers and Meta expedited my process.

Typical offer timeline:
- ~3 days (expedited)
- Up to 3 weeks (normal)

## 5. Official Meta Prep Guide

Meta has their own preparation guide here:

## Final Thoughts

- The coding rounds are very competitive — aim for fully correct & optimal solutions.
- The behavioral round is classic STAR — reuse stories from other interview prep (Amazon, etc.), but keep adding to them.
- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF META’S RESOURCES — they exist to help you succeed.
- Be proactive, prepared, and intentional — especially for coffee chats.

Good luck!
