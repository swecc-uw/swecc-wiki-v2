# Have something to say about a company's interview process?

## Adding to an existing company guide

Just edit the markdown file!

> Note: you should **only** edit add lines, don't update any existing lines unless you are doing so through a GitHub issue. Unnecessary diffs will be rejected. This is to keep the authorship of the original content intact.

## Adding a new company guide

Create a new markdown file in this directory with the name of the company in lowercase, and add a link to it in `mkdocs.yml` under the `Companies` section.
