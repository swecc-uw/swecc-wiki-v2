# Palantir Interview Guide (Intern & New Grad)

> The interview process is the same for both intern and new grad roles.

---

## 1. Recruiter Screen

The first step is a recruiter call. **You can be rejected at this stage**, so take it seriously.

### What to prepare:
- Know what Palantir does (their products, use cases, etc.)
- Be ready to explain *why* you want to work at Palantir
- Communicate your past experiences clearly and concisely

---

## 2. Leetcode-Style Technical Interview

This is a ~30-minute coding round.

### Format:
- One Leetcode-style problem
- Ask clarifying questions before starting
- Talk through your approach
- Code while explaining your thought process
- Discuss edge cases and complexity if time permits

Standard coding interview best practices apply here.

## 3. Onsite: Learning + Decomposition (Decomp)

This is a 2-round onsite. You’ll go through:

### A. Learning Round (or Re-engineering Round)
This round **varies a lot** between candidates and years:

- In previous years, it tested how quickly you can learn something new
- In 2024+, many candidates are given a **“Re-engineering”** task instead

#### Re-engineering Format:
- You're given a ~300-line codebase (abstract problem implementation)
- Your tasks:
  1. **Find and fix a bug**
  2. **Test the code**
  3. **Add new functionality**
  4. **Test again**

> Tip: This is more about understanding, reasoning, and clean updates than raw speed. Write clean, maintainable changes and talk through your process.

### B. Decomposition (Decomp) Round
This is similar to a **system design** interview — but more scoped.

- You’re given a high-level problem and asked to break it down
- The focus is on **how** you structure your thinking and solve subproblems
- You may or may not write code — some interviewers expect diagrams or verbal solutions

> Tip: Study system design patterns (e.g., how to model data, flows, services) — even for internships.

## 4. Hiring Manager Round

The final round is with a hiring manager.

### Format:
- ~30 mins behavioral
- ~30 mins technical (they’ll choose one of the three previous interview styles: coding, learning/re-engineering, or decomp)

Behavioral questions will dig into:
- Your resume
- Decisions you made
- What motivates you
- Your interest in Palantir

---

## 5. Offer Timeline

- I received my offer ~3 days after the hiring manager round
- Others have reported waiting up to a week

Expect some delay due to internal approvals.

---

## Final Notes

- **Be conversational** — I had behavioral chats even during the onsite rounds
- **Don’t try to “study” for the learning/re-engineering round** — it’s about your reasoning ability in the moment
- **Re-engineering** seems to be replacing the older learning round more consistently now
- **System design practice is helpful** for decomp, even if you're not writing code

Good luck!
