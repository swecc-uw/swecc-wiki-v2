## Interview Process Overview

### 1. Recruiter Phone Screen

This is a non-technical call with a recruiter. The goal here is to:

- Walk through your resume
- Explain your experiences in a clear, non-technical way
- Show strong communication skills

> Tip: Be able to describe your technical work so that a non-engineer can understand it.  
> Example: I explained my Amazon internship project in simple terms and the recruiter specifically told me she appreciated how clear it was.

### 2. Two Technical Rounds

After the recruiter screen, you’ll be scheduled for 2 technical interviews (3 for full time):

#### Leetcode-Style Interview
- Standard Leetcode question
- Clarify the problem
- Talk through your approach
- Write clean, correct code
- Discuss time & space complexity

#### Implementation Interview
This round is less focused on algorithms and more about writing clean, readable, testable code.

Best practices:
- Use clear and descriptive variable names
- Write code like you're writing production code
- Test your solution using print statements to validate output
- Time complexity isn’t a huge concern — correctness and code quality matter more

### 3. Final Round — Behavioral Interview

This is with a hiring manager and focuses heavily on your resume and past experiences.

Expect:
- Deep dive questions about your projects
- Challenging follow-ups (e.g. design decisions you made)
- Standard behavioral questions (conflict resolution, ownership, decision-making)

Example questions I was asked:
- *"Why did you choose DynamoDB over a relational database for your Amazon project?"*
- *"Tell me about a time you had a conflict with your manager or mentor. How did you handle it?"*

## Offer Timeline

Databricks offers can take a while — don’t panic if you don’t hear back quickly.

- For me: ~2 weeks after final round
- Some people have waited even longer (like over a month)

This is because:

- Interviewers write a feedback document
- Hiring committee reviews and makes a decision
- CEO approval is required for all offers

So the process takes time — be patient.

## Final Tips

- Be able to clearly explain your past work to non-technical audiences
- Write clean, well-structured, and readable code
- Don’t skip testing your code in the implementation round
- Prepare for deep dive behavioral questions
- Expect a slow offer timeline due to internal review processes

Good luck!
