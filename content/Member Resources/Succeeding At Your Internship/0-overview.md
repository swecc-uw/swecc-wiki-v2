# Overview


## So you've landed your first internship

Congratulations! This is a huge accomplishment and a great opportunity to gain real-world software engineering experience. However, it can also be a huge step away from what we as students are used to. Internships can be intimidating, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed when you're thrown into an unfamiliar organization with a hundred new concepts to learn.

## Enter this guide!

This guide is meant to address some of the things that we wish we had known before starting our first internships. It is not exhaustive, and of course, every internship is different, but we hope that you'll walk away feeling more confident and prepared to hit the ground running.
