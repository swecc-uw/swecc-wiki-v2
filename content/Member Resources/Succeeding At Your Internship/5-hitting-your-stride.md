# Hitting Your Stride

After a few weeks at your internship, you'll hopefully start to settle into a rhythm. This is a great time to reflect on your progress, identify areas for improvement, and also make sure you're making the most of your experience now that you're more comfortable with your work.

## How do you know when you're in a good rhythm?

You're in a good rhythm when you have:

- **Solid project understanding**: You can confidently explain what you're building and why it matters
- **Codebase familiarity**: You know where relevant files live and understand the overall architecture
- **Workflow fluency**: You can create branches, make changes, test, get reviews, and deploy without constantly checking documentation/asking for help
- **Troubleshooting abilities**: You can debug common issues and research solutions independently
- **Independence**: You work on your own and are able to drive your project forward without needing constant guidance

## How can you maintain momentum?

### Create structure in your day

Block dedicated time for focused coding (e.g. 2-3 hour chunks), meetings, learning, and anything else. Protect your [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) time and avoid distractions during these periods.

### Minimize context switching

Context switching kills productivity - you want to maintain your [flow state](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202) for as long as possible. Batch similar tasks together and avoid jumping between unrelated projects/tasks.

### Identify bottlenecks and blockers

You need to be **very** aware of your _blockers_, i.e. things that are preventing you from making progress. Blockers can be anything from needing a code review to waiting for a decision from your manager. Make sure you're communicating these blockers as soon as possible (though not before you've tried to resolve them yourself).

> You should alway try to have a few things to work on concurrently. Granted, some projects will have sequential dependencies, but there are usually a few things you can work on in parallel. For example, if you're waiting for a code review, you can work on research for a future task, or on documentation for your current task.

If you find yourself being repeatedly blocked by something, you've found a _bottleneck_. Try to resolve it yourself if it's simple, otherwise bring it up with your mentor.

> One of the most insidious bottlenecks is waiting for code reviews. You should try to find a few people that are available/eligible to review your code, and understand their schedules (e.g. do they do reviews in the morning normally? Do they have a day where they're less busy?). Then get a rotation of people to get approvals from. Make sure to discuss this with your mentor first, and be respectful of everyone's time.

### Track your work

Keep a simple log of what you've completed, what you're working on, and upcoming tasks. This helps you stay organized and makes status updates/standups much easier.

## How can you make the most of your internship experience?

### Look beyond your project

Attend tech talks, read design docs from other teams, and join company events. Interning gives you access to a wealth of knowledge and resources that have been tried and tested within industry. Take advantage of this!

### Seek learning opportunities

Ask your mentor for learning recommendations, take advantage of company training resources, and allocate time for exploring new technologies.

> I did like 4 different bootcamps that were completely unrelated to my project, and learned a ton in the process.

### Build your network

Schedule coffee chats with people from different teams and backgrounds. This is a great way to find mentors, learn about different roles, and get a better understanding of potential career paths.

### Utilize your benefits

Check if you have access to equipment stipends, learning budgets, wellness programs, or other perks that many interns overlook.

Remember that an internship are relatively low-pressure, high-reward opportunities. That being said, you should still take them seriously and put in the effort to make the most of your time.
