## Contributing

This site is in active development â€“ as the landscape of the tech world changes and innovations occur, we'll try our best to keep this site up to date.

### Prerequisites

- Node (>= 20) and NPM (>= 10) installed
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (recommended). We recommend using Obsidian to make any changes you might have, as

### Getting Started

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npx quartz build --serve` to start a local server so that you're able to view your changes in the browser.
5. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository, and create a pull request to the main repository.
7. Wait for feedback and make any necessary changes.
